# Compliance Audit Dashboard

⚠️ Skill-building project demonstrating AI-assisted SQL and Excel for compliance audit workflows and case flagging.

A SQL-based tool that demonstrates how to audit case data for compliance. Reads CSV/Excel inputs into a database, applies SQL queries to check data quality, and generates simple audit results.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Store and organize case data using a SQL schema
- Run audit queries to flag missing or invalid records
- Support MySQL or PostgreSQL for flexibility
- Provide simple reports that can help QA teams review compliance

## 🧰 Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL or PostgreSQL, AI-assisted)
- Database Schema
- SQL Queries for Auditing and Reporting

## 📁 File Overview

- `schema.sql` — Defines the database and table structure for storing eligibility case data
- `insert_data.sql` — Inserts sample data into the `cases` table for testing and querying
- `queries.sql` — SQL queries to perform audits and generate reports (e.g., count approved cases, flag non-compliant cases)

## 🧪 How to Use It

1. Create a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
2. Run **`schema.sql`** to create the `cases` table.
3. Run **`insert_data.sql`** to add sample data to the table.
4. Use **`queries.sql`** to query and audit case data for compliance.

## ✅ Use Case

Designed as a demo for auditing structured case data. Shows how SQL can be applied for quality checks and compliance reviews in a portable, audit-ready format.

#### 2. Set Up Your Database

- Open your SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench or pgAdmin)  
- Create a new database (e.g., `compliance_audit`)

#### 3. Import the Database Schema

- Run **`schema.sql`** to set up the tables needed for storing case data.
  - In your SQL client, open **`schema.sql`** and run it.

#### 4. Add Sample Data

- Run **`insert_data.sql`** to insert sample case data into the database.
  - In your SQL client, open **`insert_data.sql`** and run it.

#### 5. Run Queries for Auditing

- Use **`queries.sql`** to run audit queries.
  - Open **`queries.sql`** in your SQL client and run the queries to audit the case data.
  - Review the results to see flagged non-compliant cases.
